# employee-database

## Description 

Here we have a command application for an employee database. Keep track of your employee roster, departments, salary, and positions. Add and update employees to the database through the command line interface. This application was built using Node Module Packages: MySQL2, Inquirer, And Console.Table. Database tables and queries are generated with MySQL2 and seeded with a Bob's Burger theme. Inquirer is used for the command line interface. Console.Table prints MySQL rows to the command line interface.
